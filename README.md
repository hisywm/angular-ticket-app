## Project Introduction

This test project was developed to help me learn using Angular Material and basic CRUD using Web LocalStorage. For this project, I was assigned to create a ticketing web application. Scroll down below to see some screenshot of the results.

Some Introduction for the project - "Support ticket system were implemented to ease the use of submitting a support ticket for users and staff which let them communicate between each other more seamlessly. Users can use the system to submit a ticket and check for the ticket status without having to contact staffs to ask for it. It also helps staff to provide feedback on the submitted ticket to the customers by making a comment on the submitted ticket. It will also automatically send an email to both parties which will inform them each update on the ticket status."
